description = """
With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing
(ChIP-Seq) is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq
analysis method, we presented the Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for identifying transcript factor binding
sites. MACS captures the influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP regions and MACS
improves the spatial resolution of binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag position and
orientation.
